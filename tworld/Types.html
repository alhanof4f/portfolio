      There are many types, and these are the most commonly used types:

      <ul class="indent">
          <li>
            White Tea:
            These teas are subtle in flavor, very delicate and elegant on the tongue.
             White teas undergo the least amount of processing. The leaves are picked,
             withered (when oxidation takes place), and dried. The finished tea leaves
             are a soft grey color, consisting only of the bud and two top leaves from
             the shoot of the plant (or sometimes, only the bud for top tier white teas).
              Popular white teas include Silver Needle and Bai Mudan. Its generally understood
              that the finest come from the Fujian province of China, but white tea can be produced
              in areas including Nepal and even Yunnan, a region best known for puerh teas.<br></li>

          <li>
            Green Tea:
            is made from the leaves of the tea plant. It goes through a special process
             that keeps the leaves green and preserves their natural flavors. There are two main ways
             to make green tea: steaming and pan-firing. Japanese green teas are often steamed, which
             gives them a bright and vibrant color. Some famous Japanese green teas are Sencha and Genmaicha.
              In Japan, they sometimes shade the tea bushes before picking the leaves, which makes them even greener
               and more special. Chinese green teas, like Longjing and Gunpowder, are usually pan-fired and can have
               different shades of green. Green tea can taste different too, from buttery and grassy to smoky or even savory.<br></li>

        <li>
          Oolong Tea: is a semi-oxidized tea, and the most complex type of tea to produce.
           The best oolongs come from both Taiwan and China, though some will insist that
            Taiwanese oolongs are superior. These teas require numerous steps to produce,
             with many variations within each step. Though oolong is semi-oxidized, oxidation
             levels can be as low as 10 percent (close to a green tea) and as high as 85 percent
             (close to a black tea). Leaves are usually rolled or balled up. A great oolong can be
             steeped eight or so times, each steep releasing a new dimension of flavor. As a general rule,
              the higher the tea's oxidation level, the more steps involved in the process. Famous oolongs
               include Baozhong, Da Hong Pao, Jin Xuan (often marketed as "milk oolong" in the US because
               of its natural sweet and creamy flavors), Dong Ding, and Tieguanyin. The flavor of individual
               oolongs teas differ greatly, but usually one can expect a complex roundedness complemented
               with notes ranging from sweet and misty honey to a milky creaminess and bold roasted flavors<br></li>

    Black Tea:is perhaps the most common on the market. Darjeeling, Assam, Ceylon,
    and Keemun are a few of the most well-known. These teas are heavily oxidized and brew up strong,
     bold, and often malty. Unlike white, green, or oolongs, processed black teas are separated into a grading system.
     For example, Orange Pekoe (OP) means full-leaf tea, and BOP indicates a broken leaf black tea. In general,
     the more crushed/broken the leaf, the stronger the brew. Black teas serve as the base of popular scented teas including Earl Grey.
     In China, black tea is referred to as red tea because of its color once brewed.<br></li>

  Puerh Tea : is a fermented style of tea from the Yunnan province in China that's divided into two styles:
  sheng/raw and shou/cooked. (The latter involves a process that encourages faster fermentation.)
  After the leaves are oxidized, a small mount of moisture is left, and the leaves are then aged for months or years.
   Most puerh is sold in a pressed cake form with the year of the tea stamped on the package.
    Very old and well-aged puerh cakes can fetch tens of thousands at auction houses. Flavor and color-wise,
    some brew up light while others can be dark and intensely earthy. Perfect for pairing with a good cigar.<br></li>
