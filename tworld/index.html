       taliensis.After plain water, tea is the most widely consumed drink in the world.There are many
       different types of tea; some have a cooling, slightly bitter, and astringent flavour,
       while others have profiles that include sweet, nutty, floral, or grassy notes.

      he history of tea is long and complex, as tea has spread over thousands of years in several cultures.
       Tea originated in southwestern China during the Shang Dynasty as a medicinal beverage. The oldest
       reliable record of the tea drink has been dated to the 3rd century AD in a medical text written by Hua Tu.
        The idea of tea was introduced to Portuguese priests and merchants during the 1500s. Tea became a popular drink
        in Britain during the seventeenth decade.

         <em>However,</em> The British offered tea production as well as consumption to India to
         compete with the Chinese monopoly regarding tea.<br><br>
