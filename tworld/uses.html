    <h4>Benefits:</h4>
    <hr class="solid">
    <p>
      Tea, particularly green tea, has been consumed for centuries and is known for its numerous potential health benefits. Here are some of the benefits associated with tea consumption: <em>
        <ul class="indent">
          <li>Antioxidant properties:
            Tea contains polyphenols, which are powerful antioxidants that help protect the body from damage caused by free radicals.
             These antioxidants may help reduce the risk of chronic diseases such as heart disease and certain types of cancer.<br></li>
            </ul>
                <ul class="indent">
                  <li>
                    Heart health:
                    Regular tea consumption, especially green and black teas, has been linked to a reduced risk of heart disease.
                    The antioxidants in tea can help improve cholesterol levels, reduce blood pressure, and enhance blood vessel function.
                    <br></li>
                    </ul>

                    <ul class="indent">
                      <li>

                    Mental alertness:
                    Tea contains caffeine, which is a natural stimulant. Moderate caffeine intake from tea can help improve mental alertness,
                     focus, and concentration.
                     <br></li>
                    </ul>
                    <ul class="indent">
                      <li>

                        Weight management:
                        Some studies suggest that certain compounds in tea, such as catechins and caffeine, may help boost metabolism and aid
                        in weight management. However, it's important to note that tea alone is not a magic solution for weight loss and should
                         be combined with a healthy diet and active lifestyle.
                     <br></li>

                    <ul class="indent">
                      <li>

                        Hydration:
                         Tea is a hydrating beverage and can contribute to your daily fluid intake. While tea does contain caffeine,
                         it still provides a net hydration benefit due to its high water content.
                     <br></li>

                    <ul class="indent">
                      <li>

                        Digestive health:
                         Certain herbal teas, such as peppermint and ginger tea, have been traditionally used to soothe digestive discomfort,
                          relieve indigestion, and promote healthy digestion.

                     <br></li>

                    <ul class="indent">

                        Immune support:
                         Tea, especially green tea, contains compounds that may support immune function. The catechins in tea have antibacterial
                         and antiviral properties that can help strengthen the immune system.
                     <br></li>

                    <ul class="indent">

                        Stress relief:
                         Some herbal teas, like chamomile and lavender, have calming properties
                         and can help promote relaxation and reduce stress levels.
